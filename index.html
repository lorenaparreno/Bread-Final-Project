    <h1><strong>üìú A Brief History of Bread üåæ </strong></h1>
    <p>
      Bread, in all its various forms, is the most widely consumed food in the
      whole world. Not only is it a source of carbohydrates, it‚Äôs also
      portable and compact, which helps to explain why it has been an integral
      part of our diet for thousands of years. In fact, recent scholars
      suggests humans started baking bread at least 30,000 years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prehistoric man had already been making gruel from water and grains, so
      it was a small jump to starting cooking this mixture into a solid by
      frying it on stones. A 2010 study by the National Academy of Sciences
      discovered traces of starch (likely from the roots of cattails and
      ferns) in prehistoric mortar and pestle-like rocks. The roots would've
      been peeled and dried before they were ground into flour and mixed with
      water. Finally, the paste would've been cooked on heated rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how did humanity get from this prehistoric flatbread to an
      ultra-fluffy, grocery store loaf?

      When it comes to countries that belong in the pantheon of great culinary
      and baking traditions, Germany cannot be overlooked. Not only are their
      huge steins of beer legendary, but they also boast an epic variety of
      sausages. However, Germany is often overshadowed by the glamorous
      olive-oil-drizzled Italian focaccia and the puffy flakey French
      croissants or the long golden baguettes, German bread is nonetheless
      arguably the best in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Germany, that processed white bread common in countries like the UK
      is called "toastbrot". It's available, but it's not as popular as the
      signature German loaf. There are more options for discerning bread
      lovers, where you can find over <em>3000</em> different types of bread
      in Germany... Here's a closer look at the German bread culture.

      There are three major types of grains for bread: spelt, wheat, and rye
      or in German they're called "Dinkel", "Weizen", and "Roggen". Although,
      there are so many ways to make bread, there are too many to choose from.
      What's your pick?
